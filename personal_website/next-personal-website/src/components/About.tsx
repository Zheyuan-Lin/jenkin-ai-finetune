        <p>
          I am a Computer Science student passionate about creating innovative solutions
          through code. My journey in technology began with web development, and I've
          since expanded my expertise to include machine learning, data structures &
          algorithms, and full-stack development.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing
          to open-source projects, or solving challenging programming problems. I believe
          in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest developments
          in the tech industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm always excited to take on new projects and collaborate with others to
          create meaningful solutions. Whether it's building web applications, developing
          machine learning models, or optimizing algorithms, I'm committed to delivering
          high-quality results.
